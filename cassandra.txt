Replica Nodes

Tunable Consistency - how many nodes wait
Write -acknolage (ack)
One, Two, Three, Quorul, All, Any
Quarum - majority of nodes
any - cluster is online, event coordinator

Tunable Consistency - Write
(digest)

Read Repair for All consistency when one of the nodes digest different data

Eventual consistency

Strong Consistency when
(write consistency + read consistency) > replicaiton factor
